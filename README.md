# Gorge Wind

Link to deployed site: https://creative-gelato-0c8677.netlify.app

This project is a simple app that provides wind-speed data for five Hood River locations. Wind-sports are incredibly popular in the area, and most locals depend upon relatively ancient apps. Having a Gorge-specific app appears to be both logical and helpful.

### Stretch Goals

Honestly more a continuation of my plans for this site, it's decently barebones at this point. 

- Add more data + 24 hr forecast on the moreInfo page
- Mapbox on homepage (centered on five locations)
- Static on homepage
- Possible onclick functionality
- Center on visitor if location data shared (geocoding expansion)
- Recommendations for sports based on windspeeds of locations
