Honestly more a continuation of my plans for this site, it's decently barebones at this point. 

- Add more data + 24 hr forecast on the moreInfo page
- Mapbox on homepage (centered on five locations)
- Static on homepage
- Possible onclick functionality
- Center on visitor if location data shared (geocoding expansion)
- Recommendations for sports based on windspeeds of locations
